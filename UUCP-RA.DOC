                      Version 1.9, August 1994

UUCP-RA: Internet <==> FidoNet for Remote Access systems

Objectives: -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
    Allow SysOp and User alike to send and recieve messages to and
    from Internet in an automated and comfortable manor, checking for
    proper network addressing.

    Automatic addressing of outbound messages to the Internet/Fidonet
    Gateway specified in a configuration file.

    Automatic addressing of inbound messages from the Internet/Fidonet
    Gateway according to the name of the destination party in the
    Internet message text.

Specifics: -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
    This program scans the *.MSG subdirectory specified in the
    configuration file (typically the inbound network mail directory)
    for messages which are addressed FROM "uucp" and which are not
    marked as "local" -- that is, messages that originated outside
    of your system from a UUCP system.

        Special notice:  Now the word "UUCP" may exist anywhere
        in the "By" or "From" field of the *.MSG message.  This
        version 1.9 update was because some UUCP hosts decide to
        place UUCP at odd places in the "By" field.

    These messages are placed into the Remote Access folder secified
    in the configuration file after the message text has been searched
    for a "to:" kludge which is Internets way to specify the
    destinations name and FidoNet address. If a valid name is located,
    this program addresses the message to the User or SysOp by name,
    else the destinations name is retained -- whatever it is.

    The program then scans the Remote Access folders you specify in the
    configuration file for any messages which are addressed to "uucp"
    and which are marked as "Umoved Echo Mail" -- that is, messages
    that originated within your system and have yet to be tossed. Your
    Remote Access Folder for the Internet Mail should be set to be an
    EchoMail folder, not a Network Mail folder.

    After *.MSG messages are tossed to the Remote Access folder, they
    are erased. If messages are tossed from Remote Access to a *.MSG
    file, however, they are not marked as deleted in Remote Access,
    merely marked as having been 'moved.'

Details: -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
    When the SysOp or User write a message which is intended for the
    Internet, the 'to' field is addressed to 'uucp' and the first line
    of the message text contains the destination name and address
    prefaced with a 'To:' label.

        An example. To send mail to someone called "Mark Diogenes"
        whos network address is "netbios.com" you would address
        your message something like this below from Remote Access:

                From: FirstName LastName
                To: UUCP
                Sub: This is a sample test

                1: To: mark.diogene@netbios.com
                2:
                3: Greetings, Mark. I'm testing the gateway.

    Messages which come in from Internet to your system through your
    UUCP Gateway will be addressed FROM 'uucp' and will also have a
    'To:' in the message text. This program scans for that 'To:' string
    and attempts to extract the name of the individual to whom the
    message is intended.

    While UUCP-RA is scanning the Remote Access data base, you may hit
    the ESCAPE key to stop all processing.

Diagnostic displays: -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

    If /diag is offered on the command line, UUCP-RA will offer information
    on what it is doing while it is processing.

Other Command Line Options: -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

    If /test is offered on the command line, even messages which are
    marked as 'local' which appear in the Network Mail area of the *.MSG
    subdirectory will be tossed to the Remote Access folder.

    If /list is offered on the command line, the program will scan through
    the nodelist defined in the configuration file for UUCP gateways
    which appear in the systems Zone and Network (if there are any.)  The
    output is placed into the report file UUCP-RA.LST.

    If /listall is offered on the command line, the program will scan
    through the nodelist for all UUCP gateways and offer a report.  The
    output is placed into the report file UUCP-RA.LST.

Scan only and Toss only: -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
    /toss

        A command-line option of /toss will only review the inbound
        *.MSG messages in the network mail directory and toss them to
        the Remote Access/QBBS Data base.

    /scan

        A command-line option of /scan will only scan the Remote
        Access/QBBS data base for outbound mail and will toss them to
        the network mail directory.

Configuration elements: -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
    The environmental variable UUCPRA is used to tell UUCP-RA what
    directory the UUCP-RA.CFG configuration file is located in. If the
    environment variable is not set, the current directory is assumed.

                        set UUCPRA=C:\UTIL\

    A sample configuration file follows. This is offered for a detailed
    description of how and what this project does:

        ; This is the address of your system. This address is used to
        ; build the return address which appended to the end of every
        ; text message so that the return address is automatically
        ; offered. It is also needed so that the *.MSG message files may
        ; be properly addressed to your UUCP <==>FidoNet gatewat.
        ;
        ; The syntax which must be followed is considered 'standard:'
        ;
        ;       zone:network/node.point
        ;
        ; The zone and point are _needed_. (Please change the sample below.)

        system          1:102/890.0

        ; This is the network address of the UUCP <==> FidoNet gateway. Its
        ; syntax is the FidoNet 'Standard.' To find a UUCP <==> FidoNet gate
        ; in your area, look through the standard distribution nodelist for
        ; the User Flag UUCP or use the /list or /listall command to have
        ; the project scan for the Gateways.

        gate            1:102/851.0

        ; This is the network mail directory path. Messages found in this
        ; directory which are UUCP in origin will be tossed to Remote
        ; Accesses data base. In addition, all messages found in the Remote
        ; Access UUCP Mail folder will be tossed to this directory.
        ;
        ; Typically, this is your network mail directory. You may wish to
        ; make it a holding directory so that you may revew all of the
        ; messages prior to moving them maually to your outbound data
        ; stream. This is a possible security measure you may take.

        ; The program needs to know what message folder number in
        ; Remote Access to place inbound Internet mail into.  Though
        ; you can have any number of folders scanned for outbound
        ; mail, you may have only one inbound folder.  This is because
        ; there really isn't a good way to toss to a variety of
        ; folders any Internet mail recieved.
        ;
        ; This folder WILL NOT BE SCANNED FOR OUTBOUND MAIL UNLESS
        ; IT IS ALSO INCLUDED IN THE 'outboundfolders' CONFIGURATION
        ; ITEMS WHICH FOLLOW.

        ; All messages which appear in these folders, regardless of
        ; who they are addressed to, will be examined for a To: keyword
        ; in the message text.  The program will process the message and
        ; put it into the 'network' directory specified above.
        ;
        ; Inbound mail will go to the folder defined with the
        ; 'INBOUNDFOLDER' configuration command defined above.

        ; Every time a message is tossed from UUCP to FidoNet or from
        ; FidoNet to UUCP, a log entry in the file called UUCP-RA.LOG
        ; can be created. The value which follows the 'log' keyword must
        ; be either YES or NO. If no keyword is found or the value is
        ; other than YES or NO, then NO is used as the default.

        ; When the command /list is entered on the command line, the
        ; program will search through the nodelist specified following
        ; this keyword for all of the systems which gate UUCP which
        ; appear in the same zone and network as specified with the
        ; 'SYSTEM' command. This this way, this project will provide
        ; a list of systems which can be plugged into the 'GATE' value
        ; if the SysOp doesn't know which systems gate UUCP mail.

        nodelist        c:\fd\nodelist\nodelist.339

        ; Each message can be appended with an Internet-type origin line
        ; block. The text which follows each of the ORIGIN commands (and
        ; there is no limit to the number of said lines) will be appended
        ; to each of the messages that are tossed from Remote Access to
        ; FidoNet. This is typical of Internet messages and the text
        ; should reflect the SysOps name, the name of the FidoNet system,
        ; phone numbers and message paths and what not.
        ;
        ; Note that you should keep it short and simple if you decide to
        ; use it. Typically, three line or at most 4 lines are used and,
        ; typically, the message text follows the format that this sample
        ; file uses. As you can see, there is usually a tear line which
        ; has the systems origins and various message paths on the left
        ; with a 'clever' saying on the right. A newer habit is to limit
        ; this line to _one_ line only, however, due to the number of
        ; messages that systes handle andincreasing costs.
        ;
        ; If you don't wish to have an Origin Block appended to each and
        ; every message, simply erase the ORIGIN lines or comment them
        ; out with a ; character.
